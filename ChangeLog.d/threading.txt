Features
   * The threading platform abstraction now exposes condition variables
     in addition to mutexes.

Requirement changes
   * Implementations of MBEDTLS_THREADING_ALT must now provide condition
     variables in addition to mutexes. Furthermore, the type of mutex
     objects provided by the platform functions is now called
     mbedtls_platform_mutex_t, distinct from the API type
     mbedtls_threading_mutex_t.
