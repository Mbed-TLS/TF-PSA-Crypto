Features
   * The threading platform abstraction now exposes condition variables
     in addition to mutexes.

Requirement changes
   * Implementations of MBEDTLS_THREADING_ALT must now provide condition
     variables in addition to mutexes. The mutex functions have changed
     in minor ways:
     - The type of mutex objects provided by the platform functions is
       now called mbedtls_platform_mutex_t, distinct from the API type
       mbedtls_threading_mutex_t.
     - The mutex_init function now returns an error code.
