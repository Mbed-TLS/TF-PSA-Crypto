   * Fix a bug in mbedtls_asn1_store_named_data() where it would sometimes leave
     an item in the output list in an inconsistent state with val.p == NULL but
     val.len > 0. Functions using the structure after that, including
     mbedtls_asn1_store_named_data() itself (and functions from the X.509
     library) would then dereference a NULL pointer. Applications that do not
     call this function (directly, or indirectly through X.509 writing) are not
     affected. Found by Linh Le and Ngan Nguyen from Calif.
