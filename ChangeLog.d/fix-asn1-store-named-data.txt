   * Fix a bug in mbedtls_asn1_store_named_data() where it would sometimes leave
     an item in the output list in an inconsistent state with val.p == NULL but
     val.len > 0. Functions using the structure after that, including
     mbedtls_asn1_store_named_data() itself would then dereference a NULL
     pointer. Applications that do not call this function are not affected.
