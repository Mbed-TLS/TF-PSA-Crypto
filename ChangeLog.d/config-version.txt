Features
   * Users can set the macro TF_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG_VERSION in the TF-PSA-Crypto
     config file to maximize backward compatibility in case of future changes
     to how the config file is interpreted. TF-PSA-Crypto will maintain
     backward compatibility on functional matters (except at major version
     changes, e.g. from 1.x.y to 2.0), but the config version may influence
     other aspect such as optimisations, or experimental options.
