Removals
   * The options MBEDTLS_NO_PLATFORM_ENTROPY,
     MBEDTLS_NO_DEFAULT_ENTROPY_SOURCES, MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT and
     MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_MIN_HARDWARE have been removed. Entropy sources are
     now controlled by MBEDTLS_PSA_BUILTIN_GET_ENTROPY and
     MBEDTLS_PSA_DRIVER_GET_ENTROPY. See “Entropy configuration” in the
     migration guide for more information.
   * MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_GET_ENTROPY_ALT, introduced in TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0.0-beta,
     has been removed in favor of MBEDTLS_PSA_DRIVER_GET_ENTROPY.

API changes
   * The custom entropy collector callback mbedtls_hardware_poll()
     (enabled by MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT) has been replaced by a
     new callback mbedtls_platform_get_entropy() with different parameters
     (enabled by MBEDTLS_PSA_DRIVER_GET_ENTROPY). See the new function's
     documentation and “Custom entropy collector” in the migration guide.
   * To build the library with only a nonvolatile seed and no actual entropy
     source, you now need to enable the new option MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_NO_SOURCES_OK.
