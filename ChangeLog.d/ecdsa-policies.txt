Bugfix
   * The algorithm policy PSA_ALG_ECDSA(PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH) no longer
     allows the usage PSA_ALG_ECDSA_ANY. This brings us into compliance
     with the PSA Crypto API (explicit requirement since version 1.1.0).
     Fixes #533.

Features
   * If a key policy specifies the deterministic variant of ECDSA, the key
     now allows verification with the randomized variant (which has
     identical behavior), and vice versa. Fixes #534.
