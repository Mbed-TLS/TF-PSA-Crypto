API changes
   * The PSA and Mbed TLS error spaces are now unified. mbedtls_xxx()
     functions can now return PSA_ERROR_xxx values.
     This will not affect most applications since the error values are
     between -32767 and -1 as before.

Removals
   * Remove many MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx error codes, superseded by PSA_ERROR_xxx.
     See the 4.0 migration guide for details.
