API changes
   * The PSA and Mbed TLS error space are now unified. This means that
     psa_xxx() functions can now potentially return MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx
     values and mbedtls_xxx() functions can return PSA_ERROR_xxx values.
     This will not affect most applications since in both cases, the
     error values are between -32767 and -1 as before.
