Features
   * Add a new function mbedtls_asn1_write_integer() that encodes an arbitrary
     precision integer into ASN.1 DER format. This function replaces
     mbedtls_asn1_write_mpi(), which has been made internal-only.
Removals
   * Remove mbedtls_asn1_write_mpi() from the public API. This has been replaced
     by mbedtls_asn1_write_integer(), which does not use the legacy mbedtls_mpi
     type.
