Changes
   * Changed the `PSA_ALG_JPAKE` macro to accommodate the hash algorithm
     parameter, to be conformant to the PSA API 1.2 PAKE extension
   * Added the `PSA_ALG_JPAKE_BASE` macro to indicate the base JPAKE algorithm
     without any hash algorithm used
   * Added the `PSA_ALG_IS_JPAKE` macro to test whether a given algorithm is
     JPAKE
