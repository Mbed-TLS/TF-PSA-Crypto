Removals
   * Previously deprecated build symbol MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT is
     removed. See documentation of MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_GET_ENTROPY_ALT as
     replacement of what should be used instead.

Features
   * To supply a platform-specific entropy source, define the compilation option
     MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_GET_ENTROPY_ALT and provide the callback function
     mbedtls_platform_get_entropy_alt(). This function should typically access
     a TRNG ("true hardware random generator") device on bare-metal platforms,
     or call an operating system function to obtain cryptographic-quality random
     data.
