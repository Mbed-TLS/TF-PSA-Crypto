Removals
   * MBEDTLS_NO_PLATFORM_ENTROPY and the previously deprecated
     MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT are removed. See the documentation of
     MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_GET_ENTROPY_ALT for a description on how the entropy
     module gathers entropy data.
   * MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_MIN_HARDWARE is also removed following the removal of
     MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT.

Features
   * To supply a platform-specific entropy source, define the compilation option
     MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_GET_ENTROPY_ALT and provide the callback function
     mbedtls_platform_get_entropy_alt(). This function should typically access
     a TRNG ("true hardware random generator") device on bare-metal platforms,
     or call an operating system function to obtain cryptographic-quality random
     data. Mbed TLS requires that a minimum of 32 bytes (not configurable) are
     returned from this function for a successful entropy gathering round.
