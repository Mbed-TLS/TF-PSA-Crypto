Features
   * Add a new function, mbedtls_asn1_get_integer(), which parses an
     ASN.1 BER/DER-encoded integer and returns a pointer to the start of
     its big-endian encoded value and its length. This allows the parsing
     of arbitrary-precision integers without using the legacy mbedtls_mpi
     type.

Removals
   * Remove the function mbedtls_asn1_get_mpi() from the public interface.
     It is replaced by mbedtls_asn1_get_integer().
