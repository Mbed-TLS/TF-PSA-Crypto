   * When a PK context for an RSA key is created by means of
     mbedtls_pk_copy_from_psa() or mbedtls_pk_copy_public_from_psa() the
     associated padding mode will be PKCS v1.5.
   * If mbedtls_pk_get_psa_attributes() is called on a PK context containing
     an RSA key the returned algorithms is
     PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN(PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH) for a sign/verify usage and
     PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_CRYPT when usage is encrypt/decrypt,
     unless the key was created with mbedtls_pk_psa_wrap().
