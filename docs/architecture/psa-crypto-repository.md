PSA-Crypto repository
=====================

## Introduction

The PSA-Crypto repository contains a reference implementation of the
[PSA Cryptography API](https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api) and its
[unified driver interface](https://armmbed.github.io/mbed-crypto/psa).
This encompasses the on-going extensions to the PSA Cryptography API like
currently PAKE.

## Requirements

* The PSA-Crypto repository exposes as public interface the cryptographic
  interface defined in the PSA cryptography API specification and solely this
  interface.
* The PSA-Crypto repository provides a way to build and test a C static and/or
  shared library exposing completely or partially the PSA cryptography API.
* The PSA-Crypto repository provides a configuration mechanism to define
  the parts of the PSA cryptography API exposed by the built C library.
* The PSA-Crypto repository is derived from the Mbed TLS repository. No
  cryptographic development activities as such will occur on the PSA-Crypto
  repository.
* The PSA-Crypto repository is derived from the Mbed TLS repository but
  it does not mean that all its content comes from Mbed TLS. It may contain a
  marginal number of files on its own.
* The PSA-Crypto repository must be able to evolve to be the development
  repository of the PSA cryptography reference implementation.
* The update of the PSA-Crypto repository from the Mbed TLS repository
  should be automated and done at a reasonably short cadence (i.e, at least
  monthly). It is expected that the automation itself evolves with the
  evolutions of the Mbed TLS repository but the less the better. The trigger
  of the updates may or may not be automated.
* The testing of the PSA-Crypto repository updates should be automated (CI).

## PSA-Crypto repository definition

Name of the GitHub repo: PSA-Crypto

### Repository tree

```bash
├── include
│   └── psa
├── core
├── drivers
│   └── builtin
│       ├── include
│       └── src
```

* The PSA cryptographic interface is defined and exposed in include/psa.
* To ease the addition and integration of various partial and/or complete
  implementations of the PSA unified driver interface (based on different
  cryptographic code bases like everest or p256-m), the implementation of the
  PSA core and the implementations of the PSA unified driver interface are
  separated into two directories: core and drivers.
* The drivers directory contains various partial and or complete
  implementations of the PSA unified driver interface, one directory per
  cryptographic code base source. The first of them being the builtin
  directory hosting the PSA-Crypto repository self-contained implementation of
  the PSA unified driver interface.

#### First phase considerations

```bash
├── include
│   └── psa
├── core
├── drivers
│   └── builtin
│       ├── include
│       │   └── mbedtls
│       └── src
├── cmake
├── doxygen
│   └── input
├── programs
├── scripts
│   ├── data_files
│   │   ├── driver_jsons
│   │   └── driver_templates
│   └── mbedtls_dev
│       └── __pycache__
└── tests
```

The builtin implementation is made of copies without modifications of Mbed TLS
files from the development branch in `drivers/builtin/include/mbedtls` and
`drivers/builtin/src`.

The core and its headers (directories include/psa and core) are copies of the
relevant Mbed TLS files from the development branch with as little as possible
modifications. The cmake and doxygen files are specific to the PSA-Crypto
repository.

All the files in scripts, programs and tests are just copies of Mbed TLS files
from the development branch or from a specific branch derived from the
development branch that we would need to rebase when we want to update the
PSA-Crypto repository according to a newer version of the development branch.
The rebase needs to be trivial in most cases which constrains what can be done
in the specific branch.

### Build system
A fair amount of projects rely on the cmake build system to integrate Mbed TLS
thus we need to provide a cmake based build system for the PSA-Crypto
repository as well. Each build system for the first phase and in the long term
is a significant amount of work thus the plan to just have a cmake build system.

### Configuration
The build-time configuration file is `include/psa/build_info.h`. This file is
included by the PSA headers (header files located in `include/psa`) and the PSA
core files (located in `core`) to access the configuration options defined in
`include/psa/crypto_config.h` or PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG_FILE. The PSA core files do
not include `include/psa/build_info.h` directly but through the `core/common.h`
file.

Both the PSA headers and the PSA core files reference Mbed TLS configuration
options. Therefore, `include/psa/build_info.h` includes the header file
`drivers/builtin/include/mbedtls/config_psa.h` which defines the Mbed TLS
configuration options as implied by the set of enabled PSA configuration
options. The goal is to eventually get rid of the Mbed TLS configuration
options, in two ways:
. For PSA headers, use the configuration options of the PSA-Crypto repository
instead of their Mbed TLS equivalent.
. For PSA core files, some code needs also to be restructured as the key
derivation and key agreement code where support for driver is yet to be added.

The build-time configuration file for the builtin implementation is
the Mbed TLS one: `include/mbedtls/build_info.h`. It is based on the
minimalist Mbed TLS configuration file `drivers/builtin/mbedtls_config.h`
(copied by `scrips/psa_crypto.py` into `drivers/builtin/include/mbedtls/` to
overwrite the Mbed TLS default configuration file). This minimalist Mbed TLS
configuration file enables only the two Mbed TLS configuration options
MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C (enable the PSA cryptography interface) and
MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG (enable the selection of the cryptographic
mechanisms supported by the PSA cryptography interface through PSA_WANT_xxx
macros). The other configuration options that need to be enabled are again
enabled by the pre-processor logic in `drivers/builtin/include/mbedtls/config_psa.h`
given `include/psa/crypto_config.h`.

### Platform abstraction layer
The PSA cryptography implementation is mostly written in portable C99 and
builds and works out of the box on systems or platforms with support for the
C standard library.

The PSA cryptography implementation assumes the availability of the following
C standard library functions:
. memory functions: memcmp(), memcpy(), memset() and memmove()
. string functions: strcmp(), strlen(), strncmp(), strncpy() and strstr()

On another side, to ease the port of the library and its usage in an embedded
context, the PSA cryptography implementation does not use directly some
functions of the standard C library but rather their equivalent platform
abstraction functions whose names are `psa_crypto_xyz` when the name of the
standard function is `xyz`. These functions are:

. dynamic memory allocation functions: psa_crypto_calloc(), psa_crypto_free()
. formatted output functions: psa_crypto_printf(), psa_crypto_fprintf() and
  psa_crypto_snprintf()
. other functions: psa_crypto_setbuf()

If the configuration option PSA_CRYPTO_STD_FUNCTIONS is enabled (default),
these platform abstraction functions are just aliases to the corresponding
standard C library functions. Otherwise, these platform abstraction functions
have to be provided as part of the integration of the PSA cryptography library.

Finally, some platform abstraction functions are not just clones of standard C
library functions, like psa_crypto_platform_entropy_nv_seed_read() for example,
see include/psa/platform.h for more information. If the configuration option
PSA_CRYPTO_STD_FUNCTIONS is enabled the PSA cryptography library provides an
implementation of most of those functions based on functions of the standard C
library though.

## Updating the main branch

The PSA-Crypto repository provides a reference implementation of the
PSA cryptography API through its main branch.

The main branch head is built from a commit of the PSA-Crypto development
branch and a commit of the Mbed TLS development branch. Updating the main
branch consists in moving its head to be based on more recent commits of the
PSA-Crypto and Mbed TLS development branches. In the following,
\<mbedtls-commit-id\> is the identifier of the commit of the Mbed TLS
development branch used to update the main branch, \<mbedtls-pr\> is
the number of the last PR merged into this commit, \<psa-crypto-commit-id\> is
the identifier of the commit of the development branch of this repository used
for the update and \<psa-crypto-pr\> the number of the last PR merged into that
commit. Just the first nine characters of the commit identifiers are used.

An update follows the following flow:

* A base-for-psa-crypto-PR\<psa-crypto-pr\> branch is created in
  https://github.com/ronald-cron-arm/mbedtls/tree/psa-crypto-repository. The
  branch is the Mbed TLS commit we want to update against plus a few additional
  commits. This specific branch is created to keep track of those few
  additional commits.
* Checkout locally the base-for-psa-crypto-PR\<psa-crypto-pr\> branch.

Build what we want to become the new head of the main branch:
* cd path/to/my/psa/crypto/repo
* git checkout -b new-main development
* git clean -fdx
* ./scripts/psa_crypto.py --mbedtls path/to/the/mbedtls/branch/checked/out/above
* git add --all
* git commit -s -m"New main head"

Create the branch for the update pull request from current main head, merge
into it the PSA-Crypto development branch to get its last version (not necessary
if the PSA-Crypto development branch has not changed since the last update)
and then update the PSA cryptography implementation by applying the patch to
end up with the same tree as the new-main branch.
* git checkout -b update-against-\<mbedtls-commit-id\>-PR\<mbedtls-pr\>-with-\<psa-crypto-commit-id\>-PR\<psa-crypto-pr\> main
* git merge development -m"Merge \<psa-crypto-commit-id\>-PR\<psa-crypto-pr\>"
* git diff HEAD new-main > patch.file
* git apply patch.file
* rm patch.file
* git add --all
* git commit -s -m"Update against \<mbedtls-commit-id\>(PR \<mbedtls-pr\>)"

Clean-up
* git branch -D new-main

* Create a PR against the main branch with the update branch created above.
* Merge the PR which completes the update.

## Comparison with the Mbed TLS cryptography library

The PSA-Crypto library does not support all the cryptographic features
that the Mbed TLS cryptographic library supports, the main area of discrepancy
being the handling of the various formats of private and public asymmetric
keys.

To be more specific, the following Mbed TLS C modules can be potentially
included in the Mbed TLS cryptography library but not in the PSA-Crypto one:
. nist_kw.c
. pem.c
. pkcs5.c
. pkcs7.c
. pkcs12.c

Furthermore, the following Mbed TLS C modules can be potentially included in
the PSA-Crypto library as the builtin driver implementation relies on them but
their interface is not public and thus may change without notice:
. asn1parse.c
. asn1write.c
. oid.c
. pk.c
. pkparse.c
. pkwrite.c

Otherwise, the PSA-Crypto library does not have support for alternative
implementations of cryptography operations as Mbed TLS does through
MBEDTLS_xxx_ALT like configuration options. Alternative implementations should
instead be provided as PSA drivers.
