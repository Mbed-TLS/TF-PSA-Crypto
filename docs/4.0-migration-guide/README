This directory contains sections intended for the migration guide
from Mbed TLS 3.6 to TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0 + Mbed TLS 4.0.

The files in this document should be markdown files with the .md
extension. They should generally contain level-2 sections (## title).
The files will be consolidated into a single cohesive document or
document set shortly before the .0 releases.

The reason to have multiple files is that each strand of work can create
one file, without worrying about where to fit in the document structure.
We'll worry about the general structure once we have the content.
Furthermore, placing different strands of work in separate files will
avoid merge conflicts (as would happen e.g. if parallel strands of
work append to the same file in concurrent pull requests).

Files can be placed in the docs/4.0-migration-guide indifferently in
mbedtls or TF-PSA-Crypto, as convenient.

Documentation that is specifically about migrating from the legacy
crypto API to the PSA crypto API should be added to the existing
docs/psa-transition.md instead.
