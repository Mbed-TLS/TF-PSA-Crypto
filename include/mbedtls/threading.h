 * \brief           Set your alternate threading implementation function
 *                  pointers and initialize global mutexes. If used, this
 *                  function must be called once in the main thread before any
 *                  other Mbed TLS function is called, and
 *                  mbedtls_threading_free_alt() must be called once in the main
 *                  thread after all other Mbed TLS functions.
 *
 * \note            Functions should return #MBEDTLS_ERR_THREADING_USAGE_ERROR
 *                  if a mutex usage error is detected. However, it is
 *                  acceptable for usage errors to result in undefined behavior
 *                  (including deadlocks and crashes) if detecting usage errors
 *                  is not practical on your platform.
 *
 * \note            The library will always unlock a mutex from the same
 *                  thread that locked it, and will never lock a mutex
 *                  in a thread that has already locked it.

 *                      function is called concurrently from multiple threads.
 * \param mutex_destroy The mutex destroy function implementation. <br>
