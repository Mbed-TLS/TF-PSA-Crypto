 * Note that division for the native integer type is always required.
 * Furthermore, a 64-bit type is always required even on a 32-bit
 * platform, but it need not support multiplication or division. In some

 * Some parts of the library may use multiplication of two unsigned 32-bit

 * removes the dependency of that library on platforms that lack a hardware
