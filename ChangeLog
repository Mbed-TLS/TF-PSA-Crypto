= TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0.0 branch released 2025-10-15

API changes
   * The experimental functions psa_generate_key_ext() and
     psa_key_derivation_output_key_ext() have been replaced by
     psa_generate_key_custom() and psa_key_derivation_output_key_custom().
     They have almost exactly the same interface, but the variable-length
     data is passed in a separate parameter instead of a flexible array
     member. This resolves a build failure under C++ compilers that do not
     support flexible array members (a C99 feature not adopted by C++).
     Fixes #9020.
   * The PSA and Mbed TLS error spaces are now unified. mbedtls_xxx()
     functions can now return PSA_ERROR_xxx values.
     This will not affect most applications since the error values are
     between -32767 and -1 as before.
   * Remove MBEDTLS_PK_RSA_ALT from the PK module.
   * MBEDTLS_ERR_PK_SIG_LEN_MISMATCH is no longer a distinct error code.
     A valid signature with trailing garbage is now reported as an invalid
     signature with all algorithms.
   * All API functions now use the PSA random generator psa_generate_random()
     internally. As a consequence, functions no longer take RNG parameters.
     Please refer to the migration guide at :
     docs/4.0-migration-guide.md.
   * Privatize the functions mbedtls_ecc_group_to_psa and
     mbedtls_ecc_group_from_psa.
   * Remove the functions mbedtls_ecc_group_to_psa() and
     mbedtls_ecc_group_from_psa(), which are no longer meaningful since
     ECC groups are no longer exposed directly in the API.
   * mbedtls_pk_verify_ext() ignores the options parameter when an
     MBEDTLS_PK_RSASSA_PSS context type is used. The function assumes that
     salt length is any and that the hash algorithm used for message, encoding
     and MGF1 is the same. An error will be returned if any of these assumptions
     is false.
   * Align the mbedtls_nist_kw_wrap() and mbedtls_nist_kw_unwrap() functions
     with the PSA Crypto API. The functions mbedtls_nist_kw_wrap() and
     mbedtls_nist_kw_unwrap() now take a PSA key identifier instead of a
     plain-text key via a custom context.
   * Remove mbedtls_pk_encrypt() and mbedtls_pk_decrypt(). Convert the
     key to PSA and use the PSA functions instead, see the migration guide for
     details.
   * Change MBEDTLS_ERR_ECP_IN_PROGRESS to be an alias of
     PSA_OPERATION_INCOMPLETE and MBEDTLS_ERR_RSA_VERIFY_FAILED to be an alias
     of PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE.
   * Rename mbedtls_pk_setup_opaque to mbedtls_pk_wrap_psa.
   * The custom entropy collector callback mbedtls_hardware_poll()
     (enabled by MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT) has been replaced by a
     new callback mbedtls_platform_get_entropy() with different parameters
     (enabled by MBEDTLS_PSA_DRIVER_GET_ENTROPY). See the new function's
     documentation and “Custom entropy collector” in the migration guide.
   * To build the library with only a nonvolatile seed and no actual entropy
     source, you now need to enable the new option
     MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_NO_SOURCES_OK.
   * Due to the entropy configuration changes, if you write a configuration file
     from scratch, the default entropy source MBEDTLS_PSA_BUILTIN_GET_ENTROPY
     now needs to be enabled explicitly.
   * The configuration options MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_RESEED_INTERVAL and
     MBEDTLS_HMAC_DRBG_RESEED_INTERVAL have been replaced by a unified
     setting of MBEDTLS_PSA_RNG_RESEED_INTERVAL.
   * The configuration option MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_FORCE_SHA256 has been removed.
     MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_RNG_HASH can now be used to select the entropy
     module's hashing algorithm.
   * The mutex functions provided by platforms where MBEDTLS_THREADING_ALT is
     enabled have changed in minor ways:
     - The type of mutex objects provided by the platform functions is
       now called mbedtls_platform_mutex_t, distinct from the API type
       mbedtls_threading_mutex_t.
     - The mutex_init function now returns an error code.
     - Mutex functions other than mutex_init can now assume that the mutex
       has been successfully initialized.
   * The Random Number Generator configuration options have been refactored.
     The following options have been removed:
     MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_C, MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_FORCE_SHA256,
     MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_MAX_GATHER, MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_MAX_SOURCES,
     MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_LEN, MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_MAX_INPUT,
     MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_MAX_REQUEST, MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_MAX_SEED_INPUT,
     MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_USE_128_BIT_KEY, MBEDTLS_HMAC_DRBG_MAX_INPUT,
     MBEDTLS_HMAC_DRBG_MAX_REQUEST, MBEDTLS_HMAC_DRBG_MAX_SEED_INPUT and
     MBEDTLS_PSA_HMAC_DRBG_MD_TYPE.
     The following options have been introduced:
     MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_RNG_HASH and MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_RNG_STRENGTH.
     See "Random number generation configuration" in the migration guide for
     more information.
   * The following PK interfaces are now private and should no longer be used.
       mbedtls_pk_type_t
       mbedtls_pk_debug_type
       mbedtls_pk_debug_item
       MBEDTLS_PK_DEBUG_MAX_ITEMS
       mbedtls_pk_info_from_type()
       mbedtls_pk_setup()
       mbedtls_pk_get_len()
       mbedtls_pk_can_do()
       mbedtls_pk_can_do_ext()
       mbedtls_pk_debug()
       mbedtls_pk_get_name()
       mbedtls_pk_get_type()
       mbedtls_pk_rsa()
       mbedtls_pk_ec()
       mbedtls_pk_parse_subpubkey()
       mbedtls_pk_write_pubkey()
       mbedtls_pk_verify_new()
   * The hmac parameter of the mbedtls_md_setup() function must now always be
     set to 0 as HMAC is no longer supported by MD. To use HMAC, please use
     the psa_mac_ API.
   * Make the following error codes aliases of their PSA equivalents, where
     xxx is a module, e.g. ASN1 or PK.
     MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx_BAD_INPUT[_DATA]     -> PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
     MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx_ALLOC_FAILED         -> PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
     MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx_[AUTH/VERIFY]_FAILED -> PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE
     MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL     -> PSA_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL
     MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx_OUTPUT_TOO_LARGE     -> PSA_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL
     MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx_INVALID_PADDING      -> PSA_ERROR_INVALID_PADDING
   * A PK context no longer associates specific algorithms with the key, except
     when wrapping a PSA key. In particular, after mbedtls_pk_copy_from_psa() or
     mbedtls_pk_copy_public_from_psa() on an RSA key, the functions
     mbedtls_pk_get_psa_attributes(), mbedtls_pk_sign() and mbedtls_pk_verify()
     will use PKCS#1v1.5 signature or encryption, regardless of the original
     key's policy.

Default behavior changes
   * In a PSA-client-only build (i.e. MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CLIENT &&
     !MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C), do not automatically enable local crypto when the
     corresponding PSA mechanism is enabled, since the server provides the
     crypto. Fixes #9126.
   * The PK module now always uses the PSA subsystem
     to perform cryptographic operations, with a few exceptions documented
     in docs/architecture/psa-migration/psa-limitations.md. This
     corresponds to the behavior of Mbed TLS 3.x when
     MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO is enabled. In effect, MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO
     is now always enabled.
   * psa_crypto_init() must be called before performing any cryptographic
     operation, including indirect requests such as parsing a key or
     certificate or starting a TLS handshake.
   * The `PSA_WANT_XXX` symbols as defined in
     tf-psa-crypto/include/psa/crypto_config.h are now always used in the
     configuration of the cryptographic mechanisms exposed by the PSA API.
     This corresponds to the configuration behavior of Mbed TLS 3.x when
     MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG is enabled. In effect, MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG
     is now always enabled and the configuration option has been removed.

Requirement changes
   * Implementations of MBEDTLS_THREADING_ALT must now provide condition
     variables in addition to mutexes.

Removals
   * Drop support for crypto alt interface. Removes MBEDTLS_XXX_ALT options
     at the module and function level for crypto mechanisms only. The remaining
     alt interfaces for platform, threading and timing are unchanged.
     Fixes #8149.
   * Drop support for VIA Padlock. Removes MBEDTLS_PADLOCK_C.
     Fixes #5903.
   * Remove many MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx error codes, superseded by PSA_ERROR_xxx.
     See the 4.0 migration guide for details.
   * Support for dynamic secure elements (i.e. MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_SE_C) was
     already marked as deprecated and it has been removed.
   * Removed the MBEDTLS_PSA_INJECT_ENTROPY configuration option from
     crypto_config.h. The functionality that this option was enabling will be
     reintroduced as part of the work on issue #8150.
   * MBEDTLS_NO_PLATFORM_ENTROPY and the previously deprecated
     MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT are removed. See the documentation of
     MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_GET_ENTROPY_ALT for a description on how the entropy
     module gathers entropy data.
   * MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_MIN_HARDWARE is also removed following the removal of
     MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT.
   * TF-PSA-Crypto does not provide an OID API. A subset of the OID
     interfaces of Mbed TLS 3.x are now in the X.509 library in
     Mbed TLS 4.x.
   * Removed the MBEDTLS_SHA3_C configuration option from crypto_config.h.
     SHA3 can now be configured with the PSA_WANT_SHA3_* options.
   * The library no longer offers interfaces to look up values by OID
     or OID by enum values. The compilation option MBEDTLS_OID_C no longer
     exists. OID tables are included in the build automatically as needed.
     OIDs that are not relevant to TF-PSA-Crypto have been removed.
   * Remove the function mbedtls_asn1_get_mpi() from the public interface.
     It is replaced by mbedtls_asn1_get_integer().
   * Remove mbedtls_asn1_write_mpi() from the public API. This has been replaced
     by mbedtls_asn1_write_integer(), which does not use the legacy mbedtls_mpi
     type.
   * Remove the legacy HKDF module (mbedtls_hkdf_xxx enabled by
     MBEDTLS_HKDF_C). Use PSA instead (psa_key_derivation_xxx with
     PSA_ALG_HKDF, enabled by PSA_WANT_ALG_HKDF).
   * Remove mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data(). Use
     mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() or
     mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list_shallow() instead.
   * The options MBEDTLS_NO_PLATFORM_ENTROPY,
     MBEDTLS_NO_DEFAULT_ENTROPY_SOURCES, MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT and
     MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_MIN_HARDWARE have been removed. Entropy sources are
     now controlled by MBEDTLS_PSA_BUILTIN_GET_ENTROPY and
     MBEDTLS_PSA_DRIVER_GET_ENTROPY. See “Entropy configuration” in the
     migration guide for more information.
   * MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_GET_ENTROPY_ALT, introduced in TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0.0-beta,
     has been removed in favor of MBEDTLS_PSA_DRIVER_GET_ENTROPY.
   * Remove the PKCS12 module, which provided the ability to read keys
     encrypted with PKCS#5 v1.5 PBES1 with a DES-based cipher.
   * Removed the `psa_pake_set_password_key()` function to comply
     with the PSA API 1.2 PAKE extension.
   * Removed the `psa_pake_get_implicit_key()` function. Removed to comply
     with PSA API 1.2 PAKE extension.
   * Support for EC curves secp224r1, secp224k1, secp192k1 and secp192r1 is
     removed.
   * mbedtls_pk_rsassa_pss_options has been removed from the interface.
   * The configuration options MBEDTLS_MD5_C, MBEDTLS_RIPEMD160_C,
     MBEDTLS_SHA1_C, MBEDTLS_SHA224_C, MBEDTLS_SHA256_C, MBEDTLS_SHA384_C and
     MBEDTLS_SHA512_C have been removed. Support for hash algorithms can now
     only be enabled through the hash-related `PSA_WANT_XXX` symbols. See
     psa-transition.md for more information.

   * The configuration options MBEDTLS_AES_C, MBEDTLS_ARIA_C,
     MBEDTLS_CAMELLIA_C, MBEDTLS_CCM_C, MBEDTLS_CHACHA20_C,
     MBEDTLS_CHACHAPOLY_C, MBEDTLS_CIPHER_C, MBEDTLS_CIPHER_MODE_CBC,
     MBEDTLS_CIPHER_MODE_CFB, MBEDTLS_CIPHER_MODE_CTR, MBEDTLS_CIPHER_MODE_OFB,
     MBEDTLS_CIPHER_MODE_XTS, MBEDTLS_CIPHER_NULL_CIPHER,
     MBEDTLS_CIPHER_PADDING_PKCS7, MBEDTLS_CIPHER_PADDING_ONE_AND_ZEROS,
     MBEDTLS_CIPHER_PADDING_ZEROS_AND_LEN, MBEDTLS_CIPHER_PADDING_ZEROS,
     MBEDTLS_CMAC_C, MBEDTLS_DES_C MBEDTLS_GCM_C and MBEDTLS_POLY1305_C have
     been removed. Support for ciphers and AEAD algorithms can now only be
     enabled through the cipher and AEAD related `PSA_WANT_XXX` symbols. The
     only padding mode now supported in CBC cipher mode is PKCS7. See
     psa-transition.md for more information.

   * The configuration options MBEDTLS_GENPRIME, MBEDTLS_PKCS1_V15,
     MBEDTLS_PKCS1_V21 and MBEDTLS_RSA_C have been removed. Support for
     RSA algorithms can now only be enabled through the RSA-related
     `PSA_WANT_XXX` symbols. See psa-transition.md for more information.

   * The configuration options MBEDTLS_ECDH_C, MBEDTLS_ECDSA_C,
     MBEDTLS_ECDSA_DETERMINISTIC, MBEDTLS_ECJPAKE_C, MBEDTLS_ECP_C,
     MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_BP256R1_ENABLED, MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_BP384R1_ENABLED,
     MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_BP512R1_ENABLED, MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_CURVE25519_ENABLED,
     MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_CURVE448_ENABLED, MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_SECP192K1_ENABLED,
     MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_SECP192R1_ENABLED, MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_SECP224R1_ENABLED,
     MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_SECP256K1_ENABLED,  MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_SECP256R1_ENABLED,
     MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_SECP384R1_ENABLED, MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_SECP521R1_ENABLE have
     been removed. Support for algorithms based on elliptic curves can now
     only be enabled through the elliptic-curve-related `PSA_WANT_XXX` symbols.
     See psa-transition.md for more information.

   * The configuration option MBEDTLS_BIGNUM_C has been removed. Support for
     big number calculations is now enabled internally only when required by
     enabled asymmetric cryptographic algorithms.
   * Removed the ability to customize psa_can_do_hash() and
     psa_can_do_cipher(), which allowed hash or cipher operations to be
     performed through a legacy implementation when PSA is not yet fully
     initialized.
   * The following options have been removed as
     they are deprecated:
         PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_ECC_KEY_PAIR
         PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_RSA_KEY_PAIR
         MBEDTLS_PSA_BUILTIN_KEY_TYPE_RSA_KEY_PAIR
         MBEDTLS_PSA_BUILTIN_KEY_TYPE_ECC_KEY_PAIR
         MBEDTLS_PSA_ACCEL_KEY_TYPE_RSA_KEY_PAIR
         MBEDTLS_PSA_ACCEL_KEY_TYPE_ECC_KEY_PAIR
         MBEDTLS_SHA256_USE_A64_CRYPTO_IF_PRESENT
         MBEDTLS_SHA256_USE_A64_CRYPTO_ONLY
   * Deprecated PSA key handle related functions and macros are removed:
     psa_open_key() and psa_close_key() functions, PSA_KEY_HANDLE_INIT
     macro and psa_key_handle_t type.
   * Deprecated PSA custom Diffie-Hellman group support functions and macros
     are removed: psa_get_key_domain_parameters() and
     psa_set_key_domain_parameters() functions, PSA_DH_FAMILY_CUSTOM and
     PSA_KEY_DOMAIN_PARAMETERS_SIZE macros.
   * The following functions have been removed from the MD module:
         mbedtls_md_list()
         mbedtls_md_info_from_string()
         mbedtls_md_get_name()
         mbedtls_md_info_from_ctx()
         mbedtls_md_file()
         mbedtls_md_hmac_starts()
         mbedtls_md_hmac_update()
         mbedtls_md_hmac_finish()
         mbedtls_md_hmac_reset()
         mbedtls_md_hmac()
     To use HMAC, please use the psa_mac_ API. Looking up hash algorithms by
     name is no longer supported.
   * Removed DES (including 3DES)

Features
   * Added new configuration option MBEDTLS_PSA_STATIC_KEY_SLOTS, which
     uses static storage for keys, enabling malloc-less use of key slots.
     The size of each buffer is given by the option
     MBEDTLS_PSA_STATIC_KEY_SLOT_BUFFER_SIZE. By default it accommodates the
     largest PSA key enabled in the build.
   * Add an interruptible version of generate key to the PSA interface.
     See psa_generate_key_iop_setup() and related functions.
   * Add an interruptible version of key agreement to the PSA interface.
     See psa_key_agreement_iop_setup() and related functions.
   * Add a new psa_key_agreement() PSA API to perform key agreement and return
     an identifier for the newly created key.
   * When the new compilation option MBEDTLS_PSA_KEY_STORE_DYNAMIC is enabled,
     the number of volatile PSA keys is virtually unlimited, at the expense
     of increased code size. This option is off by default, but enabled in
     the default mbedtls_config.h. Fixes #9216.
   * Add an interruptible version of export public-key to the PSA interface.
     See psa_export_public_key_iop_setup() and related functions.
   * MD module can now perform PSA dispatching also when
     `MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CLIENT && !MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C`, even though this
     configuration is not officially supported. This requires that a
     PSA Crypto provider library which:
     * supports the required `PSA_WANT_ALG_xxx` and
     * implements `psa_can_do_hash()` on the client interface
     is linked against Mbed TLS and that `psa_crypto_init()` is called before
     performing any PSA call.
   * Add a program (which_aes) that uses an internal function to print out
     the current implementation of AES, i.e. software, AESCE, AESNI assembly,
     or AESNI intrinsics.
   * To supply a platform-specific entropy source, define the compilation option
     MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_GET_ENTROPY_ALT and provide the callback function
     mbedtls_platform_get_entropy_alt(). This function should typically access
     a TRNG ("true hardware random generator") device on bare-metal platforms,
     or call an operating system function to obtain cryptographic-quality random
     data. Mbed TLS requires that a minimum of 32 bytes (not configurable) are
     returned from this function for a successful entropy gathering round.
   * The new function mbedtls_asn1_get_integer() parses an integer into a byte
     array. It replaces mbedtls_asn1_get_mpi().
   * Add a new function mbedtls_asn1_write_integer() that encodes an arbitrary
     precision integer into ASN.1 DER format. This function replaces
     mbedtls_asn1_write_mpi(), which has been made internal-only.
   * Introduce macros and functions for getting the current version of
     TF-PSA-Crypto at build time and at runtime. These can be accessed
     by including "tf-psa-crypto/version.h".
   * Helper symbol MBEDTLS_PK_ALG_ECDSA is added to the public "mbedtls/pk.h"
     header file. It exposes the ECDSA variant used by the PK module.
   * The threading platform abstraction now exposes condition variables
     in addition to mutexes.
   * Function mbedtls_pk_can_do_psa() is added to allow testing PK context
     capabilities against a specified algorithm and usage.
   * Users can set the macro TF_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG_VERSION in the TF-PSA-Crypto
     config file to maximize backward compatibility in case of future changes
     to how the config file is interpreted. TF-PSA-Crypto will maintain
     backward compatibility on functional matters (except at major version
     changes, e.g. from 1.x.y to 2.0), but the config version may influence
     other aspect such as optimisations, or experimental options.

Security
   * Fix a buffer underrun in mbedtls_pk_write_key_der() when
     called on an opaque key, MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO is enabled,
     and the output buffer is smaller than the actual output.
     Fix a related buffer underrun in mbedtls_pk_write_key_pem()
     when called on an opaque RSA key, MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO is enabled
     and MBEDTLS_MPI_MAX_SIZE is smaller than needed for a 4096-bit RSA key.
     CVE-2024-49195
   * Unlike previously documented, enabling MBEDTLS_PSA_HMAC_DRBG_MD_TYPE does
     not cause the PSA subsystem to use HMAC_DRBG: it uses HMAC_DRBG only when
     MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG and MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C are disabled.
     CVE-2024-45157
   * Fix a stack buffer overflow in mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw() and
     mbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der() when the bits parameter is larger than the
     largest supported curve. In some configurations with PSA disabled,
     all values of bits are affected. This never happens in internal library
     calls, but can affect applications that call these functions directly.
     CVE-2024-45158
   * Zeroize a temporary heap buffer used in psa_key_derivation_output_key()
     when deriving an ECC key pair.
   * Zeroize temporary heap buffers used in PSA operations.
   * Fix a buffer overread in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key() when the input is
     less than 3 bytes. Reported by Linh Le and Ngan Nguyen from Calif.
     CVE-2025-49601
   * Fix a vulnerability in LMS verification through which an adversary could
     get an invalid signature accepted if they could cause a hash accelerator
     to fail. Found and reported by Linh Le and Ngan Nguyen from Calif.
     CVE-2025-49600
   * On x86/amd64 platforms, with some compilers, when the library is
     compiled with support for both AESNI and software AES and AESNI is
     available in hardware, an adversary with fine control over which
     threads make progress in a multithreaded program could force software
     AES to be used for some time when the program starts. This could allow
     the adversary to conduct timing attacks and potentially recover the
     key. In particular, this attacker model may be possible against an SGX
     enclave.
     The same vulnerability affects GCM acceleration, which could allow
     a similarly powerful adversary to craft GCM forgeries.
     CVE-2025-52496
   * Fix a bug in mbedtls_asn1_store_named_data() where it would sometimes leave
     an item in the output list in an inconsistent state with val.p == NULL but
     val.len > 0. Functions using the structure after that, including
     mbedtls_asn1_store_named_data() itself would then dereference a NULL
     pointer. Applications that do not call this function are not affected.
     Found by Linh Le and Ngan Nguyen from Calif.
     CVE-2025-48965
   * Fix an integer underflow that could occur when parsing malformed PEM
     keys, which could be used by an attacker capable of feeding encrypted
     PEM keys to a user. This could cause a crash or information disclosure.
     Found and reported by Linh Le and Ngan Nguyen from Calif.
     CVE-2025-52497
   * Fix a timing side channel in the implementation of PKCS#7 padding
     which would allow an attacker who can request decryption of arbitrary
     ciphertexts to recover the plaintext through a timing oracle attack.
     Reported by Ka Lok Wu from Stony Brook University and Doria Tang from
     The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
     CVE-2025-49087
   * Fix a timing side channel in CBC-PKCS7 decryption that could
     allow an attacker who can submit chosen ciphertexts to recover
     some plaintexts through a timing-based padding oracle attack.

   * Fix a local timing side-channel in modular inversion and GCD that was
     exploitable in RSA key generation and other RSA operations (see the full
     advisory for details), allowing a local attacker to fully recover the
     private key. This can be exploited on some Arm-v9 CPUs by an unprivileged
     attacker running code on the same core (SSBleed), or when Trustzone-M is
     used, by the non-secure side abusing timer interrupts (M-Step), and
     probably in other similar settings as well. Found and reported
     independently by: SSBleed: Chang Liu (Tsinghua University) and Trevor E.
     Carlson (National University of Singapore); M-Step: Cristiano Rodrigues
     (University of Minho), Marton Bognar (DistriNet, KU Leuven), Sandro Pinto
     (University of Minho), Jo Van Bulck (DistriNet, KU Leuven). CVE-2025-54764

Bugfix
   * MBEDTLS_ASN1_PARSE_C and MBEDTLS_ASN1_WRITE_C are now automatically enabled
     as soon as MBEDTLS_RSA_C is enabled. Fixes #9041.
   * Fix interference between PSA volatile keys and built-in keys
     when MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_BUILTIN_KEYS is enabled and
     MBEDTLS_PSA_KEY_SLOT_COUNT is more than 4096.
   * Fix missing constraints on the AES-NI inline assembly which is used on
     GCC-like compilers when building AES for generic x86_64 targets. This
     may have resulted in incorrect code with some compilers, depending on
     optimizations. Fixes #9819.
   * Fix rare concurrent access bug where attempting to operate on a
     non-existent key while concurrently creating a new key could potentially
     corrupt the key store.
   * Fix invalid JSON schemas for driver descriptions used by
     generate_driver_wrappers.py.
   * Fix the build when MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG is enabled and the built-in
     CMAC is enabled, but no built-in unauthenticated cipher is enabled.
     Fixes #9209.
   * Fix issue of redefinition warning messages for _GNU_SOURCE in
     entropy_poll.c and sha_256.c. There was a build warning during
     building for linux platform.
     Resolves #9026
   * Fix unintended performance regression when using short RSA public keys.
     Fixes #9232.
   * Fix error handling when creating a key in a dynamic secure element
     (feature enabled by MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_SE_C). In a low memory condition,
     the creation could return PSA_SUCCESS but using or destroying the key
     would not work. Fixes #8537.
   * Fix redefinition warnings when SECP192R1 and/or SECP192K1 are disabled.
     Fixes #9029.
   * Fix undefined behaviour (incrementing a NULL pointer by zero length) when
     passing in zero length additional data to multipart AEAD.
   * Document and enforce the limitation of mbedtls_psa_register_se_key()
     to persistent keys. Resolves #9253.
   * Fix a memory leak that could occur when failing to process an RSA
     key through some PSA functions due to low memory conditions.
   * Fix a compilation warning in pk.c when PSA is enabled and RSA is disabled.
   * Fix psa_cipher_decrypt() with CCM* rejecting messages less than 3 bytes
     long. Credit to Cryptofuzz. Fixes #9314.
   * Fix undefined behavior in some cases when mbedtls_psa_raw_to_der() or
     mbedtls_psa_der_to_raw() is called with bits=0.
   * When MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C was disabled and MBEDTLS_ECDSA_C enabled,
     some code was defining 0-size arrays, resulting in compilation errors.
     Fixed by disabling the offending code in configurations without PSA
     Crypto, where it never worked. Fixes #9311.
   * Remove Everest Visual Studio 2010 compatibility headers, which could
     shadow standard CRT headers inttypes.h and stdbool.h with incomplete
     implementatios if placed on the include path.
   * Fix issue where psa_key_derivation_input_integer() is not detecting
     bad state after an operation has been aborted.
   * Fix failures of PSA multipart or interruptible operations when the
     library or the application is built with a compiler where
     "union foo x = {0}" does not initialize non-default members of the
     union, such as GCC 15 and some versions of Clang 18. This affected MAC
     multipart operations, MAC-based key derivation operations, interruptible
     signature, interruptible verification, and potentially other operations
     when using third-party drivers. This also affected one-shot MAC
     operations using the built-in implementation. Fixes #9814.
   * On entry to PSA driver entry points that set up a multipart operation
     ("xxx_setup"), the operation object is supposed to be all-bits-zero.
     This was sometimes not the case when an operation object is reused,
     or with compilers where "union foo x = {0}" does not initialize
     non-default members of the union. The PSA core now ensures that this
     guarantee is met in all cases. Fixes #9975.
   * Resolved build issue with C++ projects using TF-PSA-Crypto when compiling
     with the MSVC toolset v142 and earlier. Fixes mbedtls issue #7087.
   * Silence spurious -Wunterminated-string-initialization warnings introduced
     by GCC 15. Fixes #9944.
   * Fix a sloppy check in LMS public key import, which could lead to accepting
     keys with a different LMS or LM-OTS types on some platforms. Specifically,
     this could happen on platforms where enum types are smaller than 32 bits
     and compiler optimization is enabled. Found and reported by Linh Le and
     Ngan Nguyen from Calif.
   * Fix a race condition on x86/amd64 platforms in AESNI support detection
     that could lead to using software AES in some threads at the very
     beginning of a multithreaded program. Reported by Solar Designer.
     Fixes #9840.
   * Fix mbedtls_base64_decode() on inputs that did not have the correct
     number of trailing equal signs, or had 4*k+1 digits. They were accepted
     as long as they had at most two trailing equal signs. They are now
     rejected. Furthermore, before, on inputs with too few equal signs, the
     function reported the correct size in *olen when it returned
     MBEDTLS_ERR_BASE64_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, but truncated the output to the
     last multiple of 3 bytes.
   * When calling mbedtls_asn1_write_raw_buffer() with NULL, 0 as the last two
     arguments, undefined behaviour would be triggered, in the form of a call to
     memcpy(..., NULL, 0). This was harmless in practice, but could trigger
     complains from sanitizers or static analyzers.
   * Fix occasional CMake parallel build failure when building both the
     static and shared tfpsacrypto libraries. Fixes #286.
   * PAKE returns PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE instead of PSA_ERROR_DATA_INVALID
     when the signature in Schnorr NIZKP is invalid.

Changes
   * Cryptography and platform configuration options have been migrated
     from the Mbed TLS library configuration file mbedtls_config.h to
     crypto_config.h that is now the TF-PSA-Crypto configuration file.
     The reference and test custom configuration files respectively in
     configs/ and tests/configs/ have been updated accordingly.
     To migrate custom Mbed TLS configurations where
     MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG is disabled, you should first adapt them
     to the PSA configuration scheme based on PSA_WANT_XXX symbols
     (see psa-conditional-inclusion-c.md for more information).
     To migrate custom Mbed TLS configurations where
     MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG is enabled, you should migrate the
     cryptographic and platform configuration options from mbedtls_config.h
     to crypto_config.h (see the 4.0 configuration guide at
     docs/4.0-migration-guide/configuration.md which includes
     configuration details and examples).
   * Improve performance of PSA key generation with ECC keys: it no longer
     computes the public key (which was immediately discarded). Fixes #9732.
   * Make the file p256-m.h internal, it is no longer installed or documented.
   * Added the `key_confirmation` field to the PAKE cipher suite to conform to
     PSA API 1.2 PAKE extension
   * Added the `psa_pake_cs_get_key_confirmation()` function which retrieves
     the value from a cipher suite, the `psa_pake_cs_set_key_confirmation()`
     function which declares the value for a cipher suite
   * Now the functionality of `psa_pake_set_password_key()` is implemented in
     `psa_pake_setup()` function, as per the PSA API 1.2 PAKE extension.
   * Changed the `PSA_ALG_JPAKE` macro to accommodate the hash algorithm
     parameter, to be conformant to the PSA API 1.2 PAKE extension
   * Added the `PSA_ALG_IS_JPAKE` macro to test whether a given algorithm is
       JPAKE
   * All tf-psa-crypto private headers were moved to a private subdirectory
   * Implemented the `psa_pake_get_shared_key()` function, compliant with the
     PSA API 1.2 PAKE extension, replacement for `psa_pake_get_implicit_key()`
