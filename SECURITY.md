## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you think you have found a security vulnerability in TF-PSA-Crypto, then
please send an email to the security team at
<mbed-tls-security@lists.trustedfirmware.org>.

## Security Incident Handling Process

Our security process is detailed in our
[security
center](https://developer.trustedfirmware.org/w/mbed-tls/security-center/).

Its primary goal is to ensure fixes are ready to be deployed when the issue
goes public.

## Maintained branches

Only the `main` branch gets security fixes. Users are urged to always use the
latest version of the `main` branch.

## Threat model

We classify attacks based on the capabilities of the attacker.

### Remote attacks

In this section, we consider an attacker who can observe and modify data sent
over the network. This includes observing the content and timing of individual
packets, as well as suppressing or delaying legitimate messages, and injecting
messages.

The TF-PSA-Crypto library aims to fully protect against remote attacks. More
specifically, it aims to enable network protocol implementations that use it to
perform cryptographic operations, as well as applications based on such network
protocol implementations, to provide full protection against remote attacks.

**Warning!** Block ciphers do not yet achieve full protection against attackers
who can measure the timing of packets with sufficient precision. For details
and workarounds see the [Block Ciphers](#block-ciphers) section.

### Local attacks

In this section, we consider an attacker who can run software on the same
machine. The attacker has insufficient privileges to directly access the
TF-PSA-Crypto library assets such as memory and files.

#### Timing attacks

The attacker is able to observe the timing of instructions executed by
the TF-PSA-Crypto library by leveraging shared hardware that both the
TF-PSA-Crypto library and the attacker have access to. Typical attack vectors
include cache timings, memory bus contention and branch prediction.

TF-PSA-Crypto provides limited protection against timing attacks. The cost of
protecting against timing attacks widely varies depending on the granularity of
the measurements and the noise present. Therefore the protection in
TF-PSA-Crypto is limited. We are only aiming to provide protection against
**publicly documented attack techniques**.

As attacks keep improving, so does TF-PSA-Crypto's protection. TF-PSA-Crypto is
moving towards a model of fully timing-invariant code, but has not reached this
point yet.

**Remark:** Timing information can be observed over the network or through
physical side channels as well. Remote and physical timing attacks are covered
in the [Remote attacks](remote-attacks) and [Physical
attacks](physical-attacks) sections respectively.

**Warning!** Block ciphers do not yet achieve full protection. For
details and workarounds see the [Block Ciphers](#block-ciphers) section.

#### Local non-timing side channels

The attacker code running on the platform has access to some sensor capable of
picking up information on the physical state of the hardware while the
TF-PSA-Crypto library is running. This could for example be an analogue-to-digital
converter on the platform that is located unfortunately enough to pick up the
CPU noise.

TF-PSA-Crypto doesn't make any security guarantees against local non-timing-based
side channel attacks. If local non-timing attacks are present in a use case or
a user application's threat model, they need to be mitigated by the platform.

#### Local fault injection attacks

Software running on the same hardware can affect the physical state of the
device and introduce faults.

TF-PSA-Crypto doesn't make any security guarantees against local fault injection
attacks. If local fault injection attacks are present in a use case or a user
application's threat model, they need to be mitigated by the platform.

### Physical attacks

In this section, we consider an attacker who has access to physical information
about the hardware the TF-PSA-Crypto library is running on and/or can alter the
physical state of the hardware (e.g. power analysis, radio emissions or fault
injection).

TF-PSA-Crypto doesn't make any security guarantees against physical attacks. If
physical attacks are present in a use case or a user application's threat
model, they need to be mitigated by physical countermeasures.

### Caveats

#### Out-of-scope countermeasures

TF-PSA-Crypto has evolved organically and a well defined threat model hasn't
always been present. Therefore, TF-PSA-Crypto might have countermeasures against
attacks outside the above defined threat model.

The presence of such countermeasures don't mean that TF-PSA-Crypto provides
protection against a class of attacks outside of the above described threat
model. Neither does it mean that the failure of such a countermeasure is
considered a vulnerability.

#### Block ciphers

Currently there are four block ciphers in TF-PSA-Crypto: AES, CAMELLIA, ARIA and
DES. The pure software implementation of these block ciphers uses lookup
tables, which are vulnerable to timing attacks.

These timing attacks can be physical, local or depending on network latency
even remote. The attacks can result in key recovery.

**Workarounds:**

- Turn on hardware acceleration for AES. This is supported only on selected
  architectures and currently only available for AES. See configuration options
  `TF_PSA_CRYPTO_AESCE_C` and `TF_PSA_CRYPTO_AESNI_C` for details.
- Add a secure alternative implementation (typically hardware acceleration) for
  the vulnerable cipher. See the [PSA Cryptography Driver Interface](
  docs/proposed/psa-driver-interface.md) for more information.
- Use cryptographic mechanisms that are not based on block ciphers. In
  particular, for authenticated encryption, use ChaCha20/Poly1305 instead of
  block cipher modes. For random generation, use HMAC\_DRBG instead of CTR\_DRBG.
