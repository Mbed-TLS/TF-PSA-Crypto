/**
 * \brief Combines a high-level and low-level error code together.
 *
 *        This function can be called directly however it is usually
 *        called via the #MBEDTLS_ERROR_ADD macro.
 *
 *        While a value of zero is not a negative error code, it is still an
 *        error code (that denotes success) and can be combined with both a
 *        negative error code or another value of zero.
 *
 * \note  The distinction between low-level and high-level error codes is
 *        obsolete since TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0 and Mbed TLS 4.0. It is still
 *        present in the code due to the heritage from Mbed TLS <=3,
 *        where low-level and high-level error codes could be added.
 *        New code should not make this distinction and should just
 *        propagate errors returned by lower-level modules unless there
 *        is a good reason to report a different error code in the
 *        higher-level module.
 *
 * \note  When invasive testing is enabled via #MBEDTLS_TEST_HOOKS, also try to
 *        call \link mbedtls_test_hook_error_add \endlink.
 *
 * \param high      High-level error code, i.e. error code from the module
 *                  that is reporting the error.
 *                  This can be 0 to just propagate a low-level error.
 * \param low       Low-level error code, i.e. error code returned by
 *                  a lower-level function.
 *                  This can be 0 to just return a high-level error.
 * \param file      file where this error code combination occurred.
 * \param line      line where this error code combination occurred.
