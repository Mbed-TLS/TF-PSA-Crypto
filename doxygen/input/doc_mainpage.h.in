/**
 * @mainpage TF-PSA-Crypto v@TF-PSA-Crypto_VERSION@ source code documentation
 *
 * This documentation describes the application programming interface (API)
 * of TF-PSA-Crypto.
 * It was automatically generated from specially formatted comment blocks in
 * TF-PSA-Crypto's source code using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl).
 *
 * ## Main entry points
 *
 * You can explore the full API from the “Files” or “Files list” section.
 * Locate the header file for the module that you are interested in and
 * explore its contents.
 *
 * Some parts of the API are best explored from the “Topics” or
 * “Group list” section.
 * This is notable the case for the PSA Cryptography API.
 * Note that many parts of the API are not classified under a topic and
 * can only be seen through the file structure.
 *
 * For information on configuring the library at compile time, see the
 * configuration header file psa/crypto_config.h.
